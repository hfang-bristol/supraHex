CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.3
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Allow the function "visHexMulComp" to have user-input the number of rows and columns for a rectangle grid wherein the planes are placed
    
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.2
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Add a new function "visHexAnimate" to animate multiple component planes of a supra-hexagonal grid


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.1
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Fix the batch algorithm allowing for processing an input data containing many zero entries


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Add new functions for advanced heatmap visualisation and tree-based analysis of sample relationships


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.2
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Add a new function "sMapOverlay" to overlay additional data to the trained map

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o A pure R implementation of a self-organising learning algorithm as applied to the symmetric topology of the supra-hexagonal map

    o Dozens of functions for post-processing the trained map with multiple purposes, including: (i) visualizations of map indexes, hits and patterns; (ii) partitioning of the map into continuous clusters (i.e. gene meta-clusters) as they are different from gene clusters in an individual map node; and (iii) reordering of sample-specific map components (i.e. sample correlation)

    o Several omics datasets used to illustrate the functionalities supported in supraHex
